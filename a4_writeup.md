# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part for me was the has won function and coding it to check every winning combination to see if it was fufilled and then ending the game.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
You could make it so after the player played then the computer would take next move and chose any open spot and take it as O or whatever, having this continue after the person went each time.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
Since their are only 9 starting moves and a technical best play against each you could have the computer pre programmed to play against each, and continue that for each proceding move as their arent that many combinations
